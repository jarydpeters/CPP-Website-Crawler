This repo was made to assist in finding and removing a deprecated topic from a company website. 

The program takes a phrase and a URL and searches it and its linked pages for the keyword phrase. 

It outputs all URL's within the website where the phrase was found to "matched_urls.txt"

It does not search externally-linked websites.

It does NOT use SSL verification and is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if it were to be used in a production environment
